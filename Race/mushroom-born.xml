		<description>
			<html>&lt;p&gt;Mushroom Born are humanoids who live in little groups in forests and caves. They are typically abandoned babies of any race who grew together with mushrooms and were possibly raised by Myconid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Myconid Traits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the following racial traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ability Score Increase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or you increase three different scores by 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The Mushroom Born are long lived and know for their wisdom, They reach physical maturity by 20 years old, no one has ever heard of a Mushroom Born dying of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Your walking speed is 30 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Darkvision.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spore Resistance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Due to your mushroom nature you have resistance to poison damage and have advantage on saving throws to resist poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mushroom Dance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Once per short or long rest, you can use an Action to do a Mushroom Dance to regain 1d10 + your constitution modifier HP, No one knows what the dance means and where it originated from, It's a secret only held by the eldest of Mushroom Born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spore Cloud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You can disengage as a bonus action by releasing a cloud of spores to cover your escape, every enemy within 5 feet of you has to make a Constitution saving throw equal to 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Constitution modifier.
On a failed saving throw the spores enter the enemy's respiratory system causing them to cough and sneeze, they have disadvantage on their next attack. On a successful saving throw nothing happens, the spore cloud dissipates at the end of your turn, you can't use this ability again until you take a short or long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycelial Network.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You can cast Speak with plants at will on mushrooms and other fungi you come across due to your fungi nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for the character.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
