			<html>&lt;p&gt;At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals the hit point number in its stat block or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, it can spend Hit Dice during a short rest to regain hit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. If you don’t issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If you are incapacitated or absent, the beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. The beast never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;If the beast dies, you can obtain a new companion by spending 8 hours magically bonding with a beast that isn’t hostile to you and that meets the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3rd-Level Drakewarden Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The drake is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying Drake Companion stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its Draconic Essence trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once you summon the drake, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to summon it.&lt;/p&gt;

			<html>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;3rd-level Swarmkeeper feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A swarm of intangible nature spirits has bonded itself to you and can assist you in battle. While you're alive, the swarm remains in your space, crawling on you or flying and skittering around you within your space. You determine its appearance, or you generate its appearance by rolling on the Swarm Appearance table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 class="caption"&gt;Swarm Appearance&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;d4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Appearance&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Swarming insects&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Miniature twig blights&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Fluttering birds&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Playful pixies&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on each of your turns, you can cause the swarm to assist you in one of the following ways, immediately after you hit a creature with an attack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attack’s target takes 1d6 piercing damage from the swarm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attack’s target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be moved by the swarm up to 15 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are moved by the swarm 5 feet horizontally in a direction of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="sidebar"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;It’s Your Swarm&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Swarmkeeper’s swarm and spells are reflections of the character’s bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger’s magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts &lt;i&gt;gaseous form&lt;/i&gt;, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the &lt;i&gt;arcane eye&lt;/i&gt; spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don’t change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character’s narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Also, remember that the swarm’s appearance is yours to customize, and don’t feel confined to a single appearance. Perhaps the spirits’ look changes with the ranger’s mood or with the seasons. You decide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</html>
