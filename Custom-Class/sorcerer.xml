&lt;p&gt;The current phase of your Lunar Embodiment can affect your Metamagic feature. Each Lunar Embodiment phase is associated with certain schools of magic, as shown here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Moon.&lt;/strong&gt; Abjuration and conjuration spells&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Whenever you use Metamagic on a spell of a school of magic associated with your current Lunar Embodiment phase, you can reduce the sorcery points spent by 1 (minimum 0). You can reduce the sorcery points spent for your Metamagic a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

&lt;ul class="unstyled"&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Moon.&lt;/strong&gt; You radiate moonlight for a moment.

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Moon.&lt;/strong&gt; You momentarily emanate gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until you make an attack or cast a spell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crescent Moon.&lt;/strong&gt; You can magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You can bring along one willing creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. That creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of your destination space. In addition, you and that creature gain resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;Once you use one of these bonus action benefits, you can’t use that benefit again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point.

			<html>&lt;p&gt;At 6th level, you gain the ability to call forth a howling creature of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon a hound of ill omen to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf’s statistics (see the &lt;i&gt;Monster Manual&lt;/i&gt; or appendix C in the &lt;i&gt;Player’s Handbook&lt;/i&gt;), with the following changes: The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

			<html>&lt;p&gt;Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a Spell from the cleric spell list.&lt;/p&gt;
