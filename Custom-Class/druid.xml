&lt;p&gt;You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d6 fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature’s game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit’s appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;You have the &lt;i&gt;guiding bolt&lt;/i&gt; spell prepared. It counts as a druid spell for you, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can have prepared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can cast &lt;i&gt;guiding bolt&lt;/i&gt; without expending a spell slot. You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;While in a starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous; your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chalice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you.

&lt;p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.&lt;/p&gt;</html>

As a bonus action, you can magically summon an incorporeal spirit to a point you can see within 60 feet of you. The spirit creates an aura in a 30-foot radius around that point. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;As a bonus action, you can move the spirit up to 60 feet to a point you can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The spirit persists for 1 minute or until you’re incapacitated. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bear Spirit.&lt;/b&gt; The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance. Each creature of your choice in the aura when the spirit appears gains temporary hit points equal to 5 + your druid level.

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hawk Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight. When a creature makes an attack roll against a target in the spirit’s aura, you can use your reaction to grant advantage to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks while in the aura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indent"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unicorn Spirit.&lt;/b&gt;The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby. You and your allies gain advantage on all ability checks made to detect creatures in the spirit’s aura.

&lt;p class="indent"&gt;In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the spell can originate from you or your wildfire spirit.&lt;/p&gt;</html>
